## 💡 Interview Tips

### Technical Questions
✅ **Explain your reasoning** - Don't just write code, explain WHY  
✅ **Discuss trade-offs** - "I used X because Y, but Z would be better if..."  
✅ **Ask clarifying questions** - "Should this handle concurrent requests?"  
✅ **Think out loud** - Share your thought process  
✅ **Start simple, then optimize** - Get it working first

### Behavioral Questions
✅ **Use STAR method** - Situation, Task, Action, Result  
✅ **Be specific** - Use real examples from your experience  
✅ **Show growth** - Explain what you learned  
✅ **Be honest** - It's okay to say "I don't know, but I'd research X"

### System Design
✅ **Clarify requirements** - Ask about scale, constraints  
✅ **Start with high-level** - Draw architecture first  
✅ **Discuss bottlenecks** - Identify potential issues  
✅ **Consider trade-offs** - CAP theorem, consistency vs availability
